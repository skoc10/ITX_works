    "## Get the Lucky Number\n",
    "A lucky number is a number of a sequence generated by a sieve algorithm: if a number in the positive integers series survives to the sieve filtering algorithm, it's lucky and survives, otherwise it disappears from the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you must obtain a list of numbers, from 1 to the needed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "First number is 1 and it survives: next to him there is number 2, that becomes the sieve's filter: every second number in the list (counting from 1) has to be filtered (as to say every even number)\n",
    ".\n",
    "After this step, the next number to survive after 1 is 3: eliminate every third number in the list (counting from 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "After this step, the next number to survive after 3 is 7: eliminate every seventh number in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the steps incrementing the filter condition at every step (as to say that the sieve filter of a new step is equal to the first number greater than the previous step last lucky number) until there are no numbers to eliminate in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the example below for a given size = 25 and nth = 5.\n",

    "\n",
    "Step 2: First sieve filter is 2: every second number from the start has to be eliminated.\n",

    "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25\n",

    "Step 3: Sieve filter is no\\\n",

    "\n",
    "1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 21, 25\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Sieve filter is now 9: every ninth number has to be eliminated, but our list now contains only 8 numbers and so the algorithm ends. The nth number of the sequence is 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the animation below, you can see the progressive sieving process for a list of 120 numbers: purple filling is for eliminated numbers, red is for lucky ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a size being the dimension of the starting list, write a function that returns the nth number of the resulting sequence after the sieving process.\n",
